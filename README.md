This code is example on how to NOT create code. C# or any other language. Focus on requirements and do the design first. 
Just then implement and without trying to produce snazzy code that is maiking your program risky and error prone.

### NOTES

#### 1 Requires .NET 4.5  
#### 2 Built and tested with VS Express 2012 for Windows Desktop. I assume VS2017 will happily do the same.
